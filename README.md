## Introduction

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm designed for searching unsorted databases or solving satisfiability problems. In this project, we utilize Grover's algorithm to find the prime factors of a biprime number (a number that is the product of two prime numbers).

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and Qiskit installed. You can install Qiskit using pip:

```bash
pip install qiskit

## Usage
Clone this repository or copy the code into your Python environment.
Ensure Qiskit is installed.
Run the script to approximately factorize the number 35,115

Ensure Qiskit is installed.
Run the script to factorize the number 35.

##Explanation
This script uses Qiskit to implement Grover's algorithm for factorizing the biprime number 35,135. The process involves creating a quantum circuit with an oracle that marks the correct factors and applying the Grover operator iteratively to amplify the probability of measuring these factors
